	abstract = {This article reviews the basic theoretical aspects of graphene, a one atom thick allotrope of carbon, with unusual two-dimensional Dirac-like electronic excitations. The Dirac electrons can be controlled by application of external electric and magnetic fields, or by altering sample geometry and/or topology. We show that the Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and integer quantum Hall effect. We discuss the electronic properties of graphene stacks and show that they vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene are strongly dependent on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. We also discuss how different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties. The effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in single layer and multilayer graphene are also presented.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional materials, e.g. graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), have attracted great interest in recent years. Identification of the thickness of two-dimensional materials will improve our understanding of their thickness-dependent properties, and also help with scientific research and applications. In this paper, we propose to use optical imaging as a simple, quantitative and universal way to identify the thickness of two-dimensional materials, i.e. mechanically exfoliated graphene, nitrogen-doped chemical vapor deposition grown graphene, graphene oxide and mechanically exfoliated MoS 2 . The contrast value can easily be obtained by reading the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) values at each pixel of the optical images of the sample and substrate, and this value increases linearly with sample thickness, in agreement with our calculation based on the Fresnel equation. This method is fast, easily performed and no expensive equipment is needed, which will be an important factor for large-scale sample production. The identification of the thickness of two-dimensional materials will greatly help in fundamental research and future applications.},

Hafnium oxide is a key dielectric for use in many advanced silicon devices. Oxygen vacancies in hafnium oxide largely determine the electronic properties of the material. We show that the electronic transitions between the states due to oxygen vacancies largely determine the optical absorption and luminescent properties of hafnium oxide. We discuss the role of oxygen vacancies as traps that facilitate charge transport in hafnium oxide films. Also, we demonstrate the fact that the electrical conductivity in hafnium oxide is controlled by the phonon-assisted tunnelling of charge carriers between traps that were identified as oxygen vacancies.},

	abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m–1) and –690 Nm–1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m–1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.
Measurements of the elastic properties of graphene agree with calculations for a defect-free material and show that it is indeed stronger than other materials.

In order to expose these groups, organic compounds at the surface must be removed. We present a qualitative evaluation of eight chemical methods commonly used to clean glass microscope slides in preparation for silanization. Mean contact angle of deionized water was measured before covalent attachment of (3-mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane to assess the efficacy of each procedure. Contact angles were also measured after silanization as a means of determining the uniformity and reproducibility of the silane monolayer. The results indicate that a 1:1 methanol/HC1 wash followed by a bath in concentrated H2SO4 removes surface contaminants most effectively and allows for a very even silanization of the glass surface.},

The effects are weaker in doped bilayer graphene due to the more conventional parabolic band dispersion. Amorphous substrates, such as polymethyl methacrylate, can induce a room temperature resistivity of comparable magnitude, although with a weaker temperature dependence.},

We establish that charged impurity scattering must dominate graphene transport as the charge neutrality point is approached by lowering the carrier density, and in the higher density regime away from the neutrality point a dual model including both charged impurities and resonant defects gives an excellent description of graphene transport on SrTiO3 substrates. We further establish that the non-universal high-density behavior of σ(n) in different graphene samples on various substrates arises from the competition among different scattering mechanisms, and it is in principle entirely possible for graphene transport to be dominated by qualitatively different scattering mechanisms at high and low carrier densities.},

	abstract = {The electrical transport properties of graphene are greatly influenced by its environment. Owing to its high dielectric constant, strontium titanate (STO) is expected to suppress the long-range charged impurity scattering and consequently to enhance the mobility. However, the absence of such enhancement has caused some controversies regarding the scattering mechanism. In graphene devices transferred from SiO2 to STO using a newly developed technique, we observe a moderate mobility enhancement near the Dirac point, which is the point of charge neutrality achieved by adjusting the Fermi level. While bulk STO is not known as a ferroelectric material, its surface was previously reported to exhibit an outward displacement of oxygen atoms and ferroelectric-like dipole moment. When placed on STO, graphene shows strong and asymmetric hysteresis in resistivity, which is consistent with the dipole picture associated with the oxygen displacement. The hysteretic response of the surface dipole moment diminishes the polarizability, therefore weakens the ability of STO to screen the Coulomb potential of the impurities.},

At carrier densities away from charge neutrality point the temperature-dependent resistivity of our graphene samples on both STO and SiO2/Si substrates show metallic behavior with contributions from Coulomb scattering and flexural phonons attributable to the presence of characteristic quasi-periodic nano-ripple arrays. Significantly, for graphene samples on STO substrates we observe an anomalous ‘slope-break’ in the temperature-dependent resistivity for T = 50 to 100 K accompanied by a decrease in mobility above 30 K. Furthermore, we observe an unusual decrease in the gate-induced doping-rate at low temperatures, despite an increase in dielectric constant of the substrate. We believe that a complex mechanism is at play as a consequence of the structural phase transition of the underlying substrate showing an anomalous transport behavior in graphene on STO. The anomalies are discussed in the context of Coulomb as well as phonon scattering.},

Here we investigate the effect of the dielectric environment of graphene and study electrical transport in multi-terminal graphene devices suspended in liquids with κ ranging from 1.9 to 33. For non-polar liquids (κ{\textless}5), we observe a rapid increase of μ(κ), with room-temperature mobility reaching {\textasciitilde}60,000 cm2 Vs−1 for devices in anisole (κ=4.3). We associate this trend with dielectric screening of charged impurities adsorbed on graphene. We observe much lower mobility μ{\textasciitilde}20,000 cm2 Vs−1 for devices in polar liquids (κ≥18) and explain it by additional scattering caused by ions present in such liquids.},

Potential explanations for such behaviour include short-range disorder7,8,9,10, ‘ripples’ in graphene’s atomic structure11,12 and the presence of charged impurities7,8,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the last of these mechanisms, by monitoring changes in electronic characteristics of initially clean graphene19 as the density of charged impurities (nimp) is increased by depositing potassium atoms onto its surface in ultrahigh vacuum. At non-zero carrier density, charged-impurity scattering produces the widely observed linear dependence1,2,3,4,5,6 of σ(n). More significantly, we find that σmin occurs not at the carrier density that neutralizes nimp, but rather the carrier density at which the average impurity potential is zero15. As nimp increases, σmin initially falls to a minimum value near 4e2/h. This indicates that σmin in the present experimental samples1,2,3,4,5,6 is governed not by the physics of the Dirac point singularity20,21, but rather by carrier-density inhomogeneities induced by the potential of charged impurities6,8,14,15.},

We provide insight into the theoretical modeling and understanding of the van der Waals (vdW) forces that hold together the 2D layers in bulk solids, as well as their excitonic properties and growth morphologies. Additionally, we highlight recent breakthroughs in TMD synthesis and characterization and discuss the newest families of 2D materials, including monoelement 2D materials (i.e., silicene, phosphorene, etc.) and transition metal carbide- and carbon nitride-based MXenes. We then discuss the doping and functionalization of 2D materials beyond graphene that enable device applications, followed by advances in electronic, optoelectronic, and magnetic devices and theory.

The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of ∼4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

Nanosize pores in graphene can make its electronic properties more favorable for transistor applications and may also be useful for molecular separations. Moreno et al. used Ullmann coupling to polymerize a dibromo-substituted diphenylbianthracene on a gold surface (see the Perspective by Sinitskii). Cyclodehydrogenation of the resulting polymer produced graphene nanoribbons, and cross-coupling of these structures created a nanoporous graphene sheet with pore sizes of about 1 nanometer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic structure in which semiconductor bands with an energy gap of 1 electron volt coexist with localized states created by the pores.
Science, this issue p. 199; see also p. 154
Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic graphene into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.

We compare our results to random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations and evaluate the relative importance of interlayer hopping, excitonic corrections, and screening from high energy excitations involving the σ bands. We find that the static, limiting value of α∗ falls in the range 0.25–0.35, which is higher than our previous result of 0.14, but still below the value expected from RPA. We show the reduced value is not a consequence of interlayer hopping effects, which were ignored in our previous analysis, but of a combination of excitonic effects in the π→π∗ particle-hole continuum, and background screening from the σ-bonded electrons. We find that σ-band screening is extremely strong at distances of less than a few nanometers, and should be highly effective at screening out short-distance, Hubbard-like interactions in graphene as well as other carbon allotropes.},

	abstract = {Weakly Interacting Graphene
Many unusual properties of graphene are a consequence of the Dirac dispersion of its electrons—a linear relationship between an electron's momentum and energy. Naïvely, this dispersion leads to the conclusion that electrons in graphene are strongly affected by mutual electrostatic interactions; however, there is little experimental evidence for strong interaction. Reed et al. (p. 805) resolved this discrepancy by using inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of graphite (which consists of loosely bound layers of graphene) to estimate how much the electric field was damped by the presence of mobile charge carriers. In fact, damping was strong at distances in excess of 1 nanometer, suggesting that graphene is more weakly interacting than was assumed.
Electrons in graphene behave like Dirac fermions, permitting phenomena from high-energy physics to be studied in a solid-state setting. A key question is whether or not these fermions are critically influenced by Coulomb correlations. We performed inelastic x-ray scattering experiments on crystals of graphite and applied reconstruction algorithms to image the dynamical screening of charge in a freestanding graphene sheet. We found that the polarizability of the Dirac fermions is amplified by excitonic effects, improving screening of interactions between quasiparticles.

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDMaterials by design is an appealing idea that is very hard to realize in practice. Combining the best of different ingredients in one ultimate material is a task for which we currently have no general solution. However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and III-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities.
ADVANCESTwo-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., NbSe2), semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with hBN allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with hBN. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes.
OUTLOOKCurrently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), direct growth of heterostructures by CVD or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6298/aac9439/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Production of van der Waals heterostructures.Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks (top) has now evolved to large-scale growth by CVD or physical epitaxy (bottom).
The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices—such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes—are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.},

The second-order spectra of single crystals and of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite are continuous and exhibit several well-defined bands which can be attributed to features in the density of vibrational states as determined from current lattice-dynamics models. The density of states deduced from the lattice-dynamics model of Nicklow, Wakabayashi, and Smith provides the best replication of the second-order Raman spectrum, but is nevertheless somewhat deficient in this regard, and in need of improvement. The dependence of the first- and second-order graphite Raman spectra on crystallite size has also been studied for a series of samples with typical dimensions Lc and La as small as 30 Å. With decreasing crystal size the features in the second-order spectrum broaden noticeably and additional broad features appear in both the first- and second-order spectra. The additional first- and second-order features are also attributed to structure in the vibrational density of states and arise from the wave-vector selection-rule relaxation that results from finite-crystal-size effects. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that the above described spectral features are intrinsic and not associated with impurity excitations.},

By delicately cleaving a sample of graphite with sticky tape, they produced something that was long considered impossible: a sheet of crystalline carbon just one atom thick, known as graphene. Many physicists believed that a 2D crystal like graphene would always roll up rather than stand free in a planar form; but Geim's group brought to an end years of unsuccessful attempts to isolate graphene, and was able to visualize the new crystal using a simple optical microscope (figure 1).},

Here, we assess the application of various surface modification methods on monolayer graphene sheets grown by chemical vapour deposition to obtain a uniform and pinhole-free ALD HfO2 film with a substantially small CET at a wafer scale. The effects of various surface modifications, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone treatment and introduction of sputtered ZnO and e-beam-evaporated Hf seed layers on monolayer graphene, and the subsequent HfO2 film formation under identical ALD process parameters were systematically evaluated. The nucleation layer provided by the Hf seed layer (which transforms to the HfO2 layer during ALD) resulted in the uniform and conformal deposition of the HfO2 film without damaging the graphene, which is suitable for downscaling the CET. After verifying the feasibility of scaling down the HfO2 thickness to achieve a CET of {\textasciitilde}1.5 nm from an array of top-gated metal-oxide-graphene field-effect transistors, we fabricated graphene heterojunction tunnelling transistors with a record-low subthreshold swing value of {\textless}60 mV/dec on an 8″ glass wafer.},

It is shown that metallic hafnium deposited in an ultra high vacuum environment readily reacts with graphene, forming a metal-carbide, rendering it unsuitable as a seed layer for the deposition of gate oxide materials. The deposition of HfO2 by reactive e-beam under an O2 partial pressure on the other hand eliminates the reaction with the underlying graphene. The uniformity of the e-beam HfO2 seed layers is found to control the uniformity of the subsequent films deposited by atomic layer deposition. Contrary to previous studies on graphite and exfoliated graphene substrates it is found that the uniformity and thickness scalability of atomic layer deposited thin films is limited on CVD graphene, most likely due to transfer induced residues on the graphene surface.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

Comparing the experimental data with the theoretical transport calculations based on charged impurity scattering, we estimate that the impurity concentration in the samples varies from 2–15×1011 cm−2. In the low carrier density limit, the conductivity exhibits values in the range of 2–12e2/h, which can be related to the residual density induced by the inhomogeneous charge distribution in the samples. The shape of the conductivity curves indicates that high mobility samples contain some short-range disorder whereas low mobility samples are dominated by long-range scatterers.},

The most promising and appealing properties of graphene are summarized from an exponentially growing literature, with a particular attention to matching production methods to characteristics and to applications. In particular, we report on the high carrier mobility value in suspended and annealed samples for electronic devices, on the thickness-dependent optical transparency and, in the mechanical section, on the high robustness and full integration of graphene in sensing device applications. Finally, we emphasize on the high potential of graphene not only as a post-silicon materials for CMOS device application but more ambitiously as a platform for post-CMOS molecular architecture in electronic information processing.},

	abstract = {Expanding the world of 2D materials
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a wide variety of potential applications in the electronics industry. However, certain compositions of 2D materials are difficult to obtain owing to the challenges in exfoliating thin sheets from bulk crystals. Zavabeti et al. exploited liquid metals to synthesize 2D Ga2O3, HfO2, Gd2O3, and Al2O3. The 2D sheets appear as a surface layer in gallium-based liquid metals after the Hf, Gd, or Al is dissolved into the bulk alloy. The 2D oxide that appears on the surface is the oxide with the lowest energy, suggesting that it should be possible to make other 2D oxides by using the same process.
Science, this issue p. 332
Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO2, Al2O3, and Gd2O3. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid metals as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.
Several new 2D materials were synthesized as surface layers of gallium-based liquid metals.

The contrast spectrum is a fast, nondestructive, easy to be carried out, and unambiguous way to identify the numbers of layers of graphene sheet. We provide two easy-to-use methods to determine the number of graphene layers based on contrast spectra: a graphic method and an analytical method.

In contrast with the conclusions of some previous work, we show that a Weyl semimetal always exists as an intermediate phase regardless of any constriant from lattice symmetries, although the interval of the critical region is sensitive to the choice of path in the parameter space and can be very narrow. We demonstrate this behavior by carrying out first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric topological insulators LaBiTe3 and LuBiTe3 and the trivial insulator BiTeI. We find that a robust Weyl-semimetal phase exists in the solid solutions LaBi1−xSbxTe3 and LuBi1−xSbxTe3 for x≈38.5\%–41.9\% and x≈40.5\%–45.1\%, respectively. A low-energy effective model is also constructed to describe the critical behavior in these two materials. In BiTeI, a Weyl semimetal also appears with applied pressure, but only within a very small pressure range, which may explain why it has not been experimentally observed.},

	abstract = {Ettore Majorana (1906–1938) disappeared while traveling by ship from Palermo to Naples in 1938. His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles have been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us still today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that established symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic particle that is its own antiparticle. This work has long had a significant impact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the particle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses as there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be truly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their antiparticles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of nuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double beta decay can exist only if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence, many efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana’s influence does not stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original consideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid-state physics where they describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of special interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one and two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes are endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances in quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been experimentally observed. This Colloquium first summarizes the basics of Majorana’s theory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich experimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own antiparticle in nuclear, particle, and solid-state physics.},

	abstract = {Weyl and Dirac semimetals are three-dimensional phases of matter with gapless electronic excitations that are protected by topology and symmetry. As three-dimensional analogs of graphene, they have generated much recent interest. Deep connections exist with particle physics models of relativistic chiral fermions, and, despite their gaplessness, to solid-state topological and Chern insulators. Their characteristic electronic properties lead to protected surface states and novel responses to applied electric and magnetic fields. The theoretical foundations of these phases, their proposed realizations in solid-state systems, and recent experiments on candidate materials as well as their relation to other states of matter are reviewed.},

By ab initio band structure calculations, we have observed the existence of multiple Weyl points in the bulk and corresponding Fermi arcs on the surface, predicting antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals in Mn 3 Ge and Mn 3 Sn. Here the chiral antiferromagnetism in the Kagome-type lattice structure is essential to determine the positions and numbers of Weyl points. Our work further reveals a new guiding principle to search for magnetic Weyl semimetals among materials that exhibit a strong anomalous Hall effect.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments and theories have suggested that strong spin–orbit coupling effects in certain band insulators can give rise to a new phase of quantum matter, the so-called topological insulator, which can show macroscopic quantum-entanglement effects1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Such systems feature two-dimensional surface states whose electrodynamic properties are described not by the conventional Maxwell equations but rather by an attached axion field, originally proposed to describe interacting quarks8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. It has been proposed that a topological insulator2 with a single Dirac cone interfaced with a superconductor can form the most elementary unit for performing fault-tolerant quantum computation14. Here we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study that reveals the first observation of such a topological state of matter featuring a single surface Dirac cone realized in the naturally occurring Bi2Se3 class of materials. Our results, supported by our theoretical calculations, demonstrate that undoped Bi2Se3 can serve as the parent matrix compound for the long-sought topological device where in-plane carrier transport would have a purely quantum topological origin. Our study further suggests that the undoped compound reached via n-to-p doping should show topological transport phenomena even at room temperature.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter in which surface states residing in the bulk insulating gap of such systems are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The study of such states was originally inspired by the robustness to scattering of conducting edge states in quantum Hall systems. Recently, such analogies have resulted in the discovery of topologically protected states in two-dimensional and three-dimensional band insulators with large spin–orbit coupling. So far, the only known three-dimensional topological insulator is BixSb1−x, which is an alloy with complex surface states. Here, we present the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations of the layered, stoichiometric crystals Sb2Te3, Sb2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. Our calculations predict that Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 are topological insulators, whereas Sb2Se3 is not. These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the Γ point. In addition, we predict that Bi2Se3 has a topologically non-trivial energy gap of 0.3 eV, which is larger than the energy scale of room temperature. We further present a simple and unified continuum model that captures the salient topological features of this class of materials.},

The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.},

	abstract = {The realization of Dirac and Weyl physics in solids has made topological materials one of the main focuses of condensed matter physics. Recently, the topic of topological nodal line semimetals, materials in which Dirac or Weyl-like crossings along special lines in momentum space create either a closed ring or line of degeneracies, rather than discrete points, has become a hot topic in topological quantum matter. Here, we review the experimentally confirmed and theoretically predicted topological nodal line semimetals, focusing in particular on the symmetry protection mechanisms of the nodal lines in various materials. Three different mechanisms: a combination of inversion and time-reversal symmetry, mirror reflection symmetry, and non-symmorphic symmetry and their robustness under the effect of spin orbit coupling are discussed. We also present a new Weyl nodal line material, the Te-square net compound KCuEuTe, which has several Weyl nodal lines including one extremely close to the Fermi level (30 meV below E). Finally, we discuss potential experimental signatures for observing exotic properties of nodal line physics.},

	abstract = {The discovery of the quantum spin Hall effect and topological insulators more than a decade ago has revolutionized modern condensed matter physics. Today, the field of topological states of matter is one of the most active and fruitful research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. The physics of topological insulators is typically well described by band theory and systems of non-interacting fermions. In contrast, several of the most fascinating effects in condensed matter physics merely exist due to electron-electron interactions, examples include superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and the Mott-Hubbard transition. The aim of this review article is to give an overview of the manifold directions which emerge when topological bandstructures and correlation physics interfere and compete. These include the study of the stability of topological bandstructures and correlated topological insulators. Interaction-induced topological phases such as the topological Kondo insulator provide another exciting topic. More exotic states of matter such as topological Mott insulator and fractional Chern insulators only exist due to the interplay of topology and strong interactions and do not have any bandstructure analogue. Eventually the relation between topological bandstructures and frustrated quantum magnetism in certain transition metal oxides is emphasized.},

They are the first known examples of topological order in bulk solids. We review the basic phenomena and experimental history, starting with the observation of topological insulator behavior in BixSb1−x by angle and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES) and continuing through measurements on other materials and by other probes. A self-contained introduction to the single-particle theory is then given, followed by the many-particle definition of a topological insulator as a material with quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The last section reviews recent work on strongly correlated topological insulators and new effects that arise from the proximity effect between a topological insulator and a superconductor. Although this article is not intended to be a comprehensive review of what is already a rather large field, we hope that it serves as a useful introduction, summary of recent progress, and guideline to future directions.},

	abstract = {A new phase of nitrogen with octagon structure has been predicted in our previous study, which we referred to as octagon-nitrogene (ON). In this work, we make further investigations of its stability and electronic structures. The phonon dispersion has no imaginary phonon modes, which indicates that ON is dynamically stable. Using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, this structure is found to be stable up to room temperature and possibly higher, and ripples that are similar to that of graphene are formed on the ON sheet. Based on the density functional theory calculation, we find that single layer ON is a two-dimension wide gap semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 4.7 eV. This gap can be decreased by stacking due to the interlayer interactions. Biaxial tensile strain and perpendicular electric field can greatly influence the band structure of ON, in which the gap decreases and eventually closes as the biaxial tensile strain or the perpendicular electric field increases. In other words, both biaxial tensile strain and a perpendicular electric field can drive the insulator-to-metal transition, and thus can be used to engineer the band gap of ON. From our results, we see that ON has potential applications in many fields, including electronics, semiconductors, optics and spintronics.},

Various techniques have been developed to produce graphene and recently we discovered the synthesis of large area graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane on Cu foils. We also showed that graphene growth on Cu is a surface-mediated process and the films were polycrystalline with domains having an area of tens of square micrometers. In this paper, we report on the effect of growth parameters such as temperature, and methane flow rate and partial pressure on the growth rate, domain size, and surface coverage of graphene as determined by Raman spectroscopy, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. On the basis of the results, we developed a two-step CVD process to synthesize graphene films with domains having an area of hundreds of square micrometers. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy clearly show an increase in domain size by changing the growth parameters. Transmission electron microscopy further shows that the domains are crystallographically rotated with respect to each other with a range of angles from about 13 to nearly 30°. Electrical transport measurements performed on back-gated FETs show that overall films with larger domains tend to have higher carrier mobility up to about 16 000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.},

These are equally spaced in normal metals and two-dimensional electron gases. In graphene, however, the charge carrier velocity is independent of their energy (like massless photons). Consequently, the LL energies are not equally spaced and include a characteristic zero-energy state (the n = 0 LL). With the use of scanning tunneling spectroscopy of graphene grown on silicon carbide, we directly observed the discrete, non-equally–spaced energy-level spectrum of LLs, including the hallmark zero-energy state of graphene. We also detected characteristic magneto-oscillations in the tunneling conductance and mapped the electrostatic potential of graphene by measuring spatial variations in the energy of the n = 0 LL.

The remote phonon-limited mobilities for SiO2, HfO2, h-BN, and Al2O3 substrates are computed using our theory. We find that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) yields the highest peak mobility, but in the practically useful high-density range, the mobility in HfO2-supported graphene is high, despite the fact that HfO2 is a high-κ dielectric with low-frequency modes. Our theory predicts that the strong temperature dependence of the total mobility effectively vanishes at very high carrier concentrations.

The phenomenon suppresses the magnitude of the quantum correction to the conductivity and may result in the complete absence of a low-field magnetoresistance, as recently found experimentally.

	abstract = {We explore the contributions to the electrical resistance of monolayer and bilayer graphene, revealing transitions between different regimes of charge carrier scattering. In monolayer graphene at low densities, a nonmonotonic variation of the resistance is observed as a function of temperature. Such behaviour is consistent with the influence of scattering from screened Coulomb impurities. At higher densities, the resistance instead varies in a manner consistent with the influence of scattering from acoustic and optical phonons. The crossover from phonon-, to charged-impurity, limited conduction occurs once the concentration of gate-induced carriers is reduced below that of the residual carriers. In bilayer graphene, the resistance exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing temperature for all densities, with the importance of short-range impurity scattering resulting in a “universal” density-independent (scaled) conductivity at high densities. At lower densities, the conductivity deviates from this universal curve, pointing to the importance of thermal activation of carriers out of charge puddles. These various assignments, in both systems, are made possible by an approach of “differential-conductance mapping”, which allows us to suppress quantum corrections to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing the resistivity.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

A salient feature of this review is a critical comparison between carrier transport in graphene and in two-dimensional semiconductor systems (e.g., heterostructures, quantum wells, inversion layers) so that the unique features of graphene electronic properties arising from its gapless, massless, chiral Dirac spectrum are highlighted. Experiment and theory, as well as quantum and semiclassical transport, are discussed in a synergistic manner in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective. Although the emphasis of the review is on those aspects of graphene transport where reasonable consensus exists in the literature, open questions are discussed as well. Various physical mechanisms controlling transport are described in depth including long-range charged impurity scattering, screening, short-range defect scattering, phonon scattering, many-body effects, Klein tunneling, minimum conductivity at the Dirac point, electron-hole puddle formation, p−n junctions, localization, percolation, quantum-classical crossover, midgap states, quantum Hall effects, and other phenomena.},

Further reduction in the dimensionality of graphene in the form of graphene quantum dots and graphene nanoribbons has compensated for the lack of a bandgap in the extended 2D material. These nanoscale graphenes exhibit finite bandgaps because of quantum confinement, making them attractive as next-generation semiconductors. Numerous fabrication methods for various types of graphenes have been developed, which can generally be categorized into ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ procedures. These methods afford, on different production scales, a wide range of graphene structures of different sizes, shapes and quality (defect density, edge roughness and so on). Atomically precise syntheses are indispensable for fundamental research and future technological development, but the projection of the existing methods to cost-effective bulk-scale fabrication techniques is required for upcoming industrial applications of graphenes.},

Overall, very good agreement is found for the structural properties and phonon dispersions, with the exception of the c∕a ratio in graphite and the associated elastic constants and phonon dispersions. Both the C33 elastic constant and the Γ to A phonon dispersions are brought to close agreement with available data once the experimental c∕a is chosen for the calculations. The vibrational free energy and the thermal expansion, the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and the specific heat are calculated using the quasiharmonic approximation. Graphite shows a distinctive in-plane negative thermal-expansion coefficient that reaches its lowest value around room temperature, in very good agreement with experiments. Thermal contraction in graphene is found to be three times as large; in both cases, bending acoustic modes are shown to be responsible for the contraction, in a direct manifestation of the membrane effect predicted by Lifshitz over 50years ago. Stacking directly affects the bending modes, explaining the large numerical difference between the thermal-contraction coefficients in graphite and graphene, notwithstanding their common physical origin.},

	abstract = {Properties of phonons—quanta of the crystal lattice vibrations—in graphene have recently attracted significant attention from the physics and engineering communities. Acoustic phonons are the main heat carriers in graphene near room temperature, while optical phonons are used for counting the number of atomic planes in Raman experiments with few-layer graphene. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally that transport properties of phonons, i.e. energy dispersion and scattering rates, are substantially different in a quasi-two-dimensional system such as graphene compared to the basal planes in graphite or three-dimensional bulk crystals. The unique nature of two-dimensional phonon transport translates into unusual heat conduction in graphene and related materials. In this review, we outline different theoretical approaches developed for phonon transport in graphene, discuss contributions of the in-plane and cross-plane phonon modes, and provide comparison with available experimental thermal conductivity data. Particular attention is given to analysis of recent results for the phonon thermal conductivity of single-layer graphene and few-layer graphene, and the effects of the strain, defects, and isotopes on phonon transport in these systems.},

Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for carrier densities below 5 × 109 cm−2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.},

This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron–hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction—a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures8,9,10,11,12 now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a macromolecule commonly used for graphene transfer and device processing, leaving a thin layer of residue to be empirically cleaned by annealing. Here we report on a systematic study of PMMA decomposition on graphene and of its impact on graphene’s intrinsic properties using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with Raman spectroscopy. TEM images revealed that the physisorbed PMMA proceeds in two steps of weight loss in annealing and cannot be removed entirely at a graphene susceptible temperature before breaking. Raman analysis shows a remarkable blue-shift of the 2D mode after annealing, implying an anneal-induced band structure modulation in graphene with defects. Calculations using density functional theory show that local rehybridization of carbons from sp2 to sp3 on graphene defects may occur in the random scission of polymer chains and account for the blue-shift of the Raman 2D mode.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials1. One such property is the ‘twist’ angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moiré pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have concentrated mostly on heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction owing to the large bandgap in hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5. Here we study a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene, in which the two graphene layers are twisted relative to each other by a certain angle. We show experimentally that, as predicted theoretically6, when this angle is close to the ‘magic’ angle the electronic band structure near zero Fermi energy becomes flat, owing to strong interlayer coupling. These flat bands exhibit insulating states at half-filling, which are not expected in the absence of correlations between electrons. We show that these correlated states at half-filling are consistent with Mott-like insulator states, which can arise from electrons being localized in the superlattice that is induced by the moiré pattern. These properties of magic-angle-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures suggest that these materials could be used to study other exotic many-body quantum phases in two dimensions in the absence of a magnetic field. The accessibility of the flat bands through electrical tunability and the bandwidth tunability through the twist angle could pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

	abstract = {Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum1. Known as Hofstadter’s butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and is one of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with periodicities of less than one nanometre) require unfeasibly large magnetic fields to reach the commensurability condition, and in artificially engineered structures (with periodicities greater than about 100 nanometres) the corresponding fields are too small to overcome disorder completely11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we demonstrate that moiré superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic modulation with ideal length scales of the order of ten nanometres, enabling unprecedented experimental access to the fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall features associated with the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers, and report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of a Hofstadter spectrum in bilayer graphene means that it is possible to investigate emergent behaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Graphene has been attracting great interest because of its distinctive band structure and physical properties. Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite. We grew large-area graphene films of the order of centimeters on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition using methane. The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5\%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.
Predominantly single-layer graphene films grow in a self-limited manner on copper and can be transferred to other substrates.

It is well known that a single graphene layer is a zero-gap semiconductor with a linear Dirac-like spectrum around the Fermi energy, while graphite shows a semimetallic behavior with a band overlap of about 41meV. In contrast to a single graphene layer, we show that two graphene layers have a parabolic spectrum around the Fermi energy and are a semimetal like graphite; however, the band overlap of 0.16meV is extremely small. Three and more graphene layers show a clear semimetallic behavior. For 11 and more layers the difference in band overlap with graphite is smaller than 10\%.},
