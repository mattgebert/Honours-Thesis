\section{Raman spectroscopy}

Raman spectroscopy uses monochromatic light to observe scattering processes on an incident material. Four fundamental processes describe the scattering behaviour: IR absorption, Rayleigh scattering, or (anti) Stokes Raman scattering. The latter (two) processes scatter light, by interactions with phonons or other excitations. This changes the incident light's momentum and energy, resulting in a frequency change. By measuring the returning light and it's spectral distribution, information is gained of the vibrational modes within the material. Devices such as charged coupled devices (using MOS or CMOS transistors) allow for sensitive measurements of the light. Photons that are scattered with the same initial energy (Rayleigh Scattering) are filtered.

\subsection{Raman in graphite}
Historically, the Raman profile for graphite is well established \cite{vidano_observation_1981}. Since the invention of the laser to make sensitive, monochromatic measurements, Raman spectroscopy conducted on graphite in the 1970's had yielded a distinct profile of the phonons existing within  materials\cite{nemanich_first-_1979,tuinstra_characterization_1970,tuinstra_raman_1970}. At the beginning of the 80's Vidano's group profiled graphite samples across multiple Raman wavelengths, properly profiling different peaks \cite{vidano_observation_1981}. 

Peaks are listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,leftmargin=0.4cm]
	\item \textbf{G} ($\approx$1580/cm)\hspace{0.2cm}The active $2E_{2g}$ mode of the hexagonal symmetry group. This traditionally has the highest peak intensity in graphite, and is doubly degenerate.
	\item \textbf{2D} ($\approx$2700/cm)\hspace{0.2cm}Higher order scattering, and overtone of D. Second highest peak in graphite. Relabelled as the 2D peak by Ferrari, originally written as G' peak.
	\item \textbf{D} ($\approx$1360/cm)\hspace{0.2cm}Attributed to edge modes (ie zone boundaries) that appear from relaxed wavevector selection rules.
	\item \textbf{D'} ($\approx$1620/cm)\hspace{0.2cm}Splitting from degenerate $E_{2g}$ due to disorder.
	\item \textbf{D''} ($\approx$2950/cm)\hspace{0.2cm}Higher order scattering.	
\end{itemize}

In graphite, the G peak is normally dominant and the 2D peak is split into at least two components at $1/2$ and $1/4$ amplitudes of the G peak. 

\subsection{Raman in graphene}
Differing layer numbers of graphene produce unique Raman signals\cite{ferrari_raman_2006,ferrari_raman_2013}. This variance in the amplitude and central frequency of maxima. The signals are unique because the vibrational properties of monolayer, bilayer and multilayer are distinct. Ferrari \etal{}. observed that Raman is a useful tool for distinguishing between these layers.

Two particular characteristics are useful for characterising layers. Firstly the amplitude of the 2D peak is roughly on the order of 2x that of the G peak in graphene. This ratio drops as the number of layers increases. Only the single layer and bilayer peaks are easily distinct from higher numbers of layers, which are somewhat indistinguishable.

This characteristic is clear in the data we've aquired of numerous graphene samples, and shown below in \cref{fig:raman_data_1}.

	\end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

Secondly, the 2D peak slowly shifts right and broadens as layers increase. This is distinguishable between a single layer, two layers and multiple layers. For a single layer, the peak fits very well to a single resonance lorentzian. For two layers, 4 lorentz peaks are used to fit the broader 2D resonance.

\end{figure}

The theoretical picture is quite intuitive for the broadening of the 2D peak seen in \cref{fig:raman_data_2}. Because the 2D peak relates to disorder, and not directly a mode of geometric structure of graphene, it is coupled to the electronic structure (see \cref{fig:raman_graphene}). A single layer of graphene has dirac points and allows single transitions in the momentum/energy profile. A bilayer of graphene instead has an extra two bands, allowing a possibility of 4 slightly different transitions near the same energy/momentum profile, contributing to the broadness seen in the Raman spectrum.

\section{Optical microscopy}
Under a microscope, graphene can be optically observed on particular substrates. Blake \etal{.} has studied the optimal wavelengths of which to observe graphene, based on the oxide thickness (SiO$_2$) \cite{blake_making_2007}. We use 285 nm \silicondioxide{} on top of Si to make graphene most visible in the green spectrum, most sensitive to the human eye for optical detection (see \cref{fig:rgb}). A consequence is that monolayer graphene can be optically identified without the need for more other measurements such as Raman or atomic force microscopy \cite{li_rapid_2013,wang_thickness_2012}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Contrast imaging}
Graphene has an opacity related to the fine structure constant. It has 2.3\% absorbtion, passing $\approx$97.7\% of the light incident on it. This quantity is actually the fine structure constant, physically defined by fundamental quantities \cite{nair_fine_2008}. Fundamentally the fine structure constant describes the electromagnetic interaction strength of particles. It is one of the few phenomena in condensed matter physics that doesn't depend on material parameters, and is pretty spectacular (excuse the optical pun) to consider. 

Graphene exhibits a universal electrical conductance minimum of $\approx 4 (e^2/h)$, and as a result \cite{kuzmenko_universal_2008} the optical conductance is also expected to have a fundamental value, behaving independent of frequency (to a broad range of photon energies). This is due to the linearity of the electronic band structure around the dirac points, which phonons interact with.

\begin{align}
	\alpha&= \frac{\pi e^2}{\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137}\\
	\pi \alpha &\approx 2.3\%
\end{align}

We can use this property of graphene's optical transmittance to perform contrast imaging of graphene, identifying single layers from the contrast between the substrate beneath and the flake of interest.  \cite{li_rapid_2013,wang_thickness_2012,ni_graphene_2007} 

If light passes from a light source through the graphene, reflects from the \silicondioxide{}, passes back through the graphene then we expect approximately 5\% absorbtion to affect our contrast change.
We calculate a contrast image by using the green pixel value ($0,1$) of each square ($G$) and taking the difference from the background mode ($G_0$) \cite{ni_graphene_2007,wang_thickness_2012}. Dividing by the background mode gives a percentage change.
\begin{align}
C = \frac{G-G_0}{G_0}\label{eqn:contrast}
\end{align}
This formula takes a G colourvalue representing the background contrast, and observes the percentage change when layers of graphene are on top of it. This percentage absorbtion should roughly match the expected 2.33\% per transmission through graphene, as the pixel value approaches black (value $G=0$).

\Cref{fig:contrast1} and \cref{fig:contrast2} both clearly indicate peaks for single layers near 6\% contrast, and multiples of that for larger layers. This is a little higher than expected, but given RGB capture is 0-255, the uncertainty in pixel capture is roughly $1/255 \approx 0.4\%$ making this deviation reasonable.
