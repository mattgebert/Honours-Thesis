%	I will then describe the devices and measurements I have made in \cref{chap:fab&characterisation}. This will regard connections to devices, which allow the measurements I have perform, and the processes used to fabricate our devices. I have made graphene devices using lithography and evaporation methods, to create electrical contacts. I will also describe the oxides I have investigated in this chapter, and the methods I have used to transfer them.
